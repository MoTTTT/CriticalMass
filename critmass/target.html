<P>Due to the growing success of Linux in the market place and the
interest shown in earlier Critical Mass releases, Q Solutions is
scaling up the Critical Mass project. 
</P>
<P>From the fourth volume in the Critical Mass Range, Q Solutions
will be using a three tier distribution structure. We are
distributing the Critical Mass products via Workgroup Distribution.
Retailers interested in selling Critical Mass products should in
future order stock from Workgroup Distribution. 
</P>
<P>Retailers will be provided with information concerning new
products in the Critical Mass range, and will be advised of
advertising plans in advance. Interested retailers should contact Q
Solutions for sample CDs and promotional posters and documentation. 
</P>
<P>Future phases of the project will include CD subscriptions,
multi-CD volumes, and supplying OEMs with CDs for distribution with
pre loaded Linux based systems. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
